This repository holds the assets, HTML, and JavaScript source code for this **Bing Maps API** activity. 

If you're new to HTML, JavaScript, or just need some guidance overall, [head to the Bing Maps API activity page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create035) on the [Microsoft Imagine site](http://imagine.microsoft.com) and follow our steps in the embedded Office Mix to complete the code for your own version of the website.

Otherwise, feel free to use our Bing Maps API activity code and assets to start your own version of a Bing Maps-enabled website, and develop the skills to turn your own ideas into something real.  

## How do I start?
To get started with the Bing Maps API, you'll want to install the following:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx)

The [Bing Maps API activity's Office Mix](https://msdn.microsoft.com/imagine/imagine-create035) has installation instructions if you need them.

## How do I use GitHub Desktop to get this?
Never done this before and just want the files to work with on your own? 

Click on the **Clone or download** button and you can make a copy of all of these files on your machine that you can work with.  Use **Open in Desktop** to open the repo in GitHub Desktop. Alternatively, **Download ZIP** and then unzip the files in a familiar location on your computer.

Remember where you save these files, so you can find them again in Visual Studio!
